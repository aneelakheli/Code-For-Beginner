## Why Loops are needed?

**Loop** are a programming elements that repeats a section of code a set of numbers of times until the desired process is completed. _Loops_ are of two types:</br>

1.**Entry Controlled loops**: In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.</br>2.**Exit Controlled Loops**: In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

Loops are needed when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of switch statements??

The **advantages** of switch statements are as follows:

- To execute multiple statements, in any case, there is no requirement of braces as in if else.
- The default may or may not use the break statement.
- We can use case number in ascending or descending order or in any random order.
- In both switch and case, we use _int_ or _char_ constant.
- We can use default anywhere in the program because every time default is executed only when there is no match of any case.
- We can execute a common set of statement for multiple cases.

The **disadvantages** of switch statements are as follows:

- float constant cannot be used in the switch as well as in the case.
- We can not use the variable expression in case.
- You cannot use the same constant in two different cases.
- We cannot use the relational expression in case.
