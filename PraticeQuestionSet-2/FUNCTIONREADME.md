# Function

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.we can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

# Important of Function

There are the following advantages of C functions.

- By using functions, we can avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program.
- We can call C functions any number of times in a program and from any place in a program.
- We can track a large C program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
- Reusability is the main achievement of C functions.

## Function Aspects

There are three aspects of a C function.

**Function declaration** A function must be declared globally in a c program to tell the compiler about the function name, function parameters, and return type.

**Function call** Function can be called from anywhere in the program. The parameter list must not differ in function calling and function declaration. We must pass the same number of functions as it is declared in the function declaration.

**Function definition** It contains the actual statements which are to be executed. It is the most important aspect to which the control comes when the function is called. Here, we must notice that only one value can be returned from the function.
